# PIKACHU

PIKACHU, a sophisticated,
unsupervised, temporal walk-based dynamic network
embedding technique that can capture both network topology as
well as highly granular temporal information. PIKACHU learns
the appropriate and meaningful representation by preserving
the temporal order of nodes. This is important information to
detect Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) as temporal order helps
to understand the lateral movement of the attacker.
